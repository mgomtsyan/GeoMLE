# GeoMLE

**2019**

Research of intrinsic dimension. We present imporvements of algorithm based on maximum likelihood estimation which reflects the manifold geometric structure. 

## Experiments

All experiments you can find in [notebook](paper/FinalNtb.ipynb):

- [x] Decribing algorithms
- [x] Test with nonuniform distibution
- [x] Dependence on manifold dimension
- [x] Dependence on number of points
- [x] Comparing algorithms with Dolan-More curves
- [x] Dependence on noise
- [ ] Dependence on neigbors (k1 and k2)


## Algorithms

In this paper we compare our approch with many famous algorithms:
* MLE
* ESS
* MIND
* DANCo
* Local PCA

We use this [implementation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/intrinsicDimension/index.html) on R.
